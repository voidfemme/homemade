1. Problem Statement
	a. You are asked to write an app (song_struct.cpp) to keep track of a relatively small music library. The app should get song information from the user.

	b. Write an interactive interface that will allow the user to 
		i.   enter album name
		ii.  enter song name
		iii. enter artist name
		iv.  enter song duration

	c. Allow the user to enter information for three albums.


Example song struct definition:
struct songs {
string album_name;
string artist_name;
string song_name;
double song_duration;
}

Sample program output:

------------------------------
Enter album name: Mirror
Enter artist name: Passenger
Enter song name: Illusion
Enter Song duration: 3.2
------------------------------

Algorithmic design:

first, design struct
