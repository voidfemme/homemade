First, I need to diagnose the problem.

Issues:
1. Bluetooth causes Zoom to crash
2. Bluetooth service must be restarted in order to switch audio profiles

MY CURRENT HARDWARE / SOFTWARE SETUP (5-10-22 2:45pm)
bluez, bluez-utils is installed
bluetoothctl
blueman
	-Does blueman have any known issues with Zoom?

[WF-1000XM4]# bluetoothctl show

General Notes from the Arch Wiki:
the generic bluetooth drive is the btusb kernel module.
( you can check whether a module is loaded by:	)
(	$ lsmod					)






NOTES FROM TALK:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9ocyiM_hGM&ab_channel=TheDianaInitiative
the canonical implementation of the Bluetooth protocol stack is BlueZ

BlueZ provides support for the core Bluetooth layers and protocols
	- Complete modular implementation
	- Symmetric multi-processing safe
	- Multithreaded data processing
	- Support for multiple Bluetooth devices
	- Real hardware abstraction
	- Standard socket interface to all layers
	- Device and service level security support.
BlueZ consists of many separate modules
	1. Bluetooth kernel subsystem core
	2. L2CAP and SCO audio kernel layers
	3. RFCOMM, BNEP, CMPT, HIDP kernel implementations
	4. HCI UART, USB, PCMCIA and virtual device drivers
	5. General Bluetooth and SDP libraries and daemons
	6. Configuration and testing utilities
	7. Protocol decoding and analysis tools

Generic Attribute tool, "GATool"
