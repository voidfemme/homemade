*  Design Goals:
*   1. make a looping menu that allows you to create and view arrays at will
*   2. The array that accesses the dynamic arrays doesn't need to be static,
*      since the goal of this is simply to become more comfortable with arrays
*      and with creating a nice UX. Not anything too fancy tho.
*   3. This means that the arrays will be stored in another array.
*   4. I want to carry over the tools I created in ./array_manip.cc and allow
*      for manipulating any array with those methods
